OCRmyPDF documentation
======================

OCRmyPDF adds an OCR text layer to scanned PDF files, allowing them to
be searched.

PDFs are the best format for scanned documents.  Unfortunately, PDFs can be difficult to work with. OCRmyPDF makes it easy to apply image processing and OCR to existing PDFs.
